# Advent of Code 2020

It's that time of year again! Time for the [__Advent of Code__](https://adventofcode.com) programming challenge. Last year I waited until the end of the competition to push my code to GitHub, but since I've been taking a peak at other peoples' code as we go it seemed only fair to push mine up as well.

I'm using Java again to solve these problems. Despite working a lot more in Python lately, Java is still my strongest language and my go-to for object-oriented programming or anything that requires complex data structures and optimizations.

The code is contained in ```src``` and input files in ```files```.
