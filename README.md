# Advent of Code 2020

It's that time of year again! Time for the [__Advent of Code__](https://adventofcode.com) programming challenge. Last year I waited until the end of the competition to push my code to GitHub, but since I've been taking a peak at other peoples' code as we go it seemed only fair to push mine up as well.

I'm using Java again to solve these problems. Despite working a lot more in Python lately, Java is still my strongest language and my go-to for object-oriented programming or anything that requires complex data structures and optimizations.

The code is contained in ```src``` and input files in ```files```. I've also included the original problem descriptions as ```README.md``` files inside ```files```.

Overall, this year was not too hard and pretty fun. There weren't any crazy mazes that took me days to optimize or problems that required an advanced understanding of modular arithmetic to solve.  (Actually, day 13 did send me Googling how to solve a set of modular arithmetic equations via the Chinese Remainder Theorem. That was probably the most abstract, non-programming problem to solve this year.)

Many of the problems involved matching up a set of answers by whittling down the possible solutions - similar to a logic puzzle or Sudoku game. Day 21 is a good example of this, where you have to decode a list of allergens in an unknown language. I also enjoyed some of the optimizations that were needed to make Part B solutions run faster.  Day 23 involved one such optimization that resulted in a beautiful, elegant solution.  I've heard from others that they were equally as proud of their code as I was of mine for this one.  Searching for sea monsters on Day 20 also was very memorable. Infinite grids and hexagonal coordinates might have been difficult for some, but these have been thrown at us in prior years, and we've learned how to deal with them pretty easily.

Really, this was just a fun year.  Thank you, whoever makes this game!  I had a fun time playing, and so did some of my co-workers.  Below is a list of co-workers with AoC code in GitHub:


* [Mark](https://github.com/mark-ferguson-kroger/aoc-2020) - Python solutions (usually much more efficient than mine, solving them with about 75% fewer lines of code than my Java solutions)
* [Marshall](https://github.com/mzarecky/advent-of-code) - Python solutions
* [Greg](https://github.com/GregNoblePhD/AOC2020/) - R solutions (Greg is a crazy R master!)
* [David](https://github.com/dwanneruchi) - Python solutions (in notebook format)
* [Travis](https://github.com/travis-sellers) - Python solutions
